# JamesCui400Projects

The folders in this repository are three projects I developed throughout my freshman year at UW Madison.
I strongly encourage you to watch the 1 minute [ Project Demos ](https://github.com/Jamescuii/JamesCui400Projects/blob/main/Cheap%20and%20Healthy%20Eats/%24Cheap%20and%20Healthy%20Eats%20Demo.mp4) before looking at the code just for a 
wholistic insight on the fundamental function of the program. Each project can be run in the terminal
or command center. However, due to the use of the JavaFX Tester Program, the Flight Finder project
must be run through a Microsoft Remote Desktop of a UW Madison computer, and thus will likely not work,
unless you remove the test programs. Enjoy! :-)
